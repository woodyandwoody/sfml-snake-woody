I am a junior in china, and this is my homework.

https://github.com/jhpy1024/sfSnake
And thanks to jhpy1024, we made our snake(or improved his sanke)
using his code.
I Changed the snake's shape, and put some Background picture, changed the BGM and added some function.
Mouse control is supported, and some character supports skills: you could erase certain kinds of fruits on the screen, and there's a video with it.
But SFML doesn't support video, so the video is a bunch of photos and a wav-form music....And this take a lot of disk space, sorry.
I thought that I could use ffmpeg to unpack a mp4 video or what while running or installing so that I could save a lot disk space but I don't know how to do, so I gave up.
You could make character of your own by changing the characer profile, you could change a lot of data so that you could form a theme or a chatacter,for more specific information please read Profiles/Character_profile_Guide.docx
I know there are a lot of bugs and mistakes in my homework, 
so please tell me if you found any. I am willing to accept your advice.

Thanks for Echo(Fudan University,黄可欣), she is my featured voice performer.
And thanks for 熵少Entropy on Bilibili, I took some of his picture.
