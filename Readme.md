这是我程序设计的大作业。

I am a junior in china, and this is my homework.

我们班在jhpy1024[发布的代码](https://github.com/jhpy1024/sfSnake)的基础上进行改动，增加功能，完成作业。

Thanks to **jhpy1024**, we made our snake(or improved his sanke) using [his code](https://github.com/jhpy1024/sfSnake).

支持鼠标 Mouse control is enabled. 

这个游戏有角色的定义，有的角色支持技能：你可以消除屏幕上特定的水果，并且带有特效。

There are different characters in this game, and some character supports skill: you could erase certain kinds of fruits on the screen, and there's a special effect with it.

你可以通过修改人物的定义文件来增加人物，指导在Profiles/Character_profile_Guide.docx中。

You could make  character of your own by changing the characer profile, you could change a lot of data so that you could form a theme or a chatacter,for more specific information please read Profiles/Character_profile_Guide.docx
